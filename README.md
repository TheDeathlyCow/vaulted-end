# Vaulted End

Vaulted End is a Polymer-based server-side Fabric mod that replaces the Elytra item frames in End City Ships with Vaults and Trial Spawners. It is intended to improve multiplayer server health by allowing new players always to be capable of obtaining Elytra (and Shulker Shells) in an old End, without having to travel thousands of blocks to find unraided End Cities.

## Trial Spawners and Vaults

End Ships are now generated with Vaults and Trial Spawners. One Shulker Trial Spawner will generate on the deck, and this spawner will always drop an Elytra Key. Two Endermite Trial Spawners also generate below deck and will reward you with Golden Carrots, Rockets, and Shulker Shells. Elytra can also be found below deck, in the Vault where the item frame used to be, and can be opened with the Elytra Key.

About a third of all ships will generate an Ominous Vault in addition to the regular one. As in Trial Chambers, if you have the Bad Omen effect, then you can get Ominous spawners to drop an Ominous Elytra Key. Beware though - the ominous spawners are much more difficult to defeat!

## Installation for Servers

This mod uses Polymer to be completely capable of running server side. Players will not need to install this mod (or any mod) to play it on your server - it is fully compatible with vanilla clients. However, it does come with a resource pack for the Elytra keys that you may wish to use. See the Polymer wiki for instructions on setting this up for your server: [https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/)

Players with vanilla clients who choose not to use the resource pack will instead see Elytra Keys as Trial Keys and Ominous Elytra Keys as Ominous Trial Keys.
